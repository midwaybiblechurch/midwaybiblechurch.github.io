<p>Pastor Jon Feusse, a native of Pelzer, served for four years on staff at Camp CoBeAc in Prudenville MI and part time locally as a youth pastor. He married Christina, and in 2007 then served as Associate Pastor of Anchor Baptist Church in South Haven, MI.</p>
                        <p>God soon blessed them with their first child and in 2010 they returned to the Greenville area so Jon could complete his B.A. in ministerial training at Bob Jones University.</p>
                        <p>It was during this time that Jon and his family came to MBC desiring to serve God. Upon graduating from BJU, Jon accepted the call as Assistant Pastor at Midway Bible Church.</p>
