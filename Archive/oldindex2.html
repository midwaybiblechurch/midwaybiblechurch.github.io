    <h2>Our Identity </h2>
    <p>Midway Bible Church was founded in early 2003 by a group of believers committed to spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Midway-Pelzer-Williamston community. Early on, the group met in private homes, the gymnasium at Spearman Elementary School and a warehouse. During this period, they secured 6 acres of land on Cherokee Road. They began building at that location and completed their current building in October of 2004.</p>
    <p>MBC is committed to the fundamental doctrines of the Bible; hence, the reason for calling it a &quot;Bible&quot; church.  The congregation is independent of any denominational control; their leaders earnestly seek to submit to the leadership of the Head of the Church, Jesus Christ. The Pastors are committed to preaching that is Christ-centered, expository and practical. </p>
    <p>MBC believes that Christ is building His church in the Midway community. We believe that we are His co-workers in this great work. We believe that Christ builds His church by the means that He has revealed in His Word, and therefore we seek to adhere to a simple, Scriptural philosophy of ministry. If you wish to partner with the Lord Jesus as He builds His kingdom in our area, we invite you to join with us. If you are seeking to know God more deeply, MBC is here to help you. We view ourselves as the voice, hands and feet of our Savior. </p>
